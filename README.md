# Snke fork
**Please note**: to make this driver compatible with the Yocto/Xilinx Kernel 6.2 and above, the Snke fork integrates the [dev_kernel_interface_changes](https://github.com/ams-OSRAM/tmf8820_21_28_driver_linux/tree/dev_kernel_interface_changes) branch from AMS OSRAM parent repo into our own main branch! On the AMS OSRAM parent repo this branch is not yet part of [main](https://github.com/ams-OSRAM/tmf8820_21_28_driver_linux/tree/main) banch (at time of writing).

# Time-of-Flight (ToF) Linux Reference Driver

The driver was developed on tested with the [ams OSRAM TMF882X_EVM_DB_DEMO Evaluation kit](https://ams-osram.com/products/boards-kits-accessories/kits/ams-tmf882x-evm-db-demo-evaluation-kit). This EVM includes a [Rasperry PI Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) where the Linux driver is operating.

1. Description

    Contains the release files for adding tmf882x support to the linux kernel

    /arch/arm/boot/dts
        Contains the device tree overlay for the TMF882X proto-
        typed on the Raspberry Pi zero. The rpi.env script is a convenience
        script for setting up build environment variables to point to a remote
        linux kernel source tree. This prototyped version uses GPIO_20 for INT
        and GPIO_16 for the "Chip-Enable" line

        -tof8820-overlay.dts
            -normal configuration, CE gpio and INT gpio
            -change the "poll_period" attribute to use polling instead of interrupts


2. Compiling

    Driver - Compiling

    1. Download Linux Kernel source:

    2. Compile Linux Kernel

    3. Compile ToF Device Tree

    4. Compile ToF driver:
       ```
       make CONFIG_SENSORS_TMF882X=m
       ```

    6. Compile ToF driver for Qualcomm linux kernel:
       ```
       make CONFIG_SENSORS_TMF882X=m CONFIG_TMF882X_QCOM_AP=y
       ```

3. Documentation

    TMF882X Driver UAPI Guide can be generated with the 'pandoc' and 'LaTeX' packages by running:
    ```
    pandoc doc\TMF882X_Driver_UAPI_Guide.md -o TMF882X_Driver_UAPI_Guide.pdf
    ```

    TMF882X Driver doxygen documentation can be generated by running
    ('DOT' package is required for call-graphs):
    ```
    doxygen
    ```
